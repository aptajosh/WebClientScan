# WebClientScan
I was searching for solution such that from browser event like button click will trigger scan command and client side scanner get invoked and scan the document.
 Though I didn't get direct solution anywhere I got reference from code project article which help me a lot i.e. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/493333/Client-Side-Printing-Scanning-in-NET.
So here is a final solution.
